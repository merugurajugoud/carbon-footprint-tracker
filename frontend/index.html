  <h1>Reducing Campus Carbon, One Step at a Time</h1>
  <p>
    College campuses generate carbon emissions through daily electricity usage,
    transportation, and events. This platform helps students understand
    where emissions come from and how small daily actions can reduce
    overall carbon impact.
  </p>

  <p class="theory">
    By following simple energy-saving practices and sustainable transport choices,
    students can significantly reduce campus carbon emissions over time.
